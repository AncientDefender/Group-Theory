# PERMUTATION GROUP ANALYSIS

This repository contains files related to the analysis of permutation groups:

- **permutation_group_deg_7.txt**: Data related to permutation groups of degree 7
- **permutation_group_deg_8.txt**: Data related to permutation groups of degree 8
- **permutation_group_deg_9.txt**: Data related to permutation groups of degree 9
- **symmetric_groups-retrospective.py**: Python script for constructing symmetric groups

## Files Description:

### permutation_group_deg_7.txt, permutation_group_deg_8.txt, permutation_group_deg_9.txt:
- These files contain data pertaining to permutation groups of different degrees.
- Each file contains group elements represented as matrices, illustrating the specific transformations
  and symmetries within the respective permutation groups.

### symmetric_groups-retrospective.py:
- This Python file sets the foundation for retrospective analyses of symmetry groups.
- The script includes functions and methods for constructing symmetric groups over the set {1,2,...,n}.

## Usage:

### Data Files (`permutation_group_deg_*.txt`):
- These files can be used for studying the structure and properties of permutation groups of any degree.
- They can be imported into computational tools for further analysis.

### Python Script (`symmetric_groups-retrospective.py`):
- To use the `symmetric_groups-retrospective.py` script, ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
- Run the script using: `python symmetric_groups-retrospective.py`.

## Notes:

### Purpose:
- The repository aims to provide resources and tools for studying permutation groups and performing
  retrospective analyses of symmetry groups.

### Data Interpretation:
- Each `permutation_group_deg_*.txt` file contains structured data specific to the degree of its subgroup.
- Interpret these files in the context of group theory and computational algebraic analysis.

### Script Functionality:
- Review the script `symmetric_groups-retrospective.py` to understand its functionality and customize it
  as needed for specific analyses or extensions.

### Contributions:
- Contributions and improvements to the data processing methods are welcome through pull requests.
